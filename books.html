        <h2>The Handmaid’s Tale (Margaret Atwood)</h2>
        <p>The Handmaid’s Tale is a defining work of dystopian literature that explores the oppression of women in a patriarchal, post-apocalyptic society. The novel examines themes of female agency, forced reproductive roles, and resistance against totalitarian regimes. (Hancock, B. (2018). A sense of hope in Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale. The British Library. Retrieved from https://www.bl.uk/20th-century-literature/articles/a-sense-of-hope-in-atwoods-the-handmaids-tale)
Through the protagonist, Offred, Atwood critiques gender dynamics and power structures, making this book a significant example of women’s representation in post-apocalyptic fiction.

        <h2>The Hunger Games (Suzanne Collins)</h2>
        <p>In The Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen is as a powerful female protagonist navigating a dystopian world marked by extreme poverty and government control. The novel highlights survival, resilience, and the struggle against oppressive systems. Katniss’s journey embodies strength, sacrifice, and defiance showing it through her way of life in District 12, learning how to hunt with resilience and even sacrifices herself to save her sister to play in the hunger games,, making the book an essential example of the representation of women in post-apocalyptic fiction.</p>
        <h2>After the Flood (Kassandra Montag)</h2>
        <p>After the Flood presents a unique take on post-apocalyptic fiction, with not using a regular setting of the post apocalypse normally being a zombie apocalypse or a nuclear fallout instead After the Flood is set after an environmental collapse, with a strong female lead, Myra, who embarks on a perilous journey in a world devastated by rising waters. This novel explores themes of motherhood, survival, and resilience in an unforgiving world. Myra’s characterization as a determined mother fighting for her daughter’s safety where she fights off raiders who are named pirates to ensure the safety of her daughter,  adds a deeply personal and emotional dimension to the representation of women in this genre.
