        <p>This project is about the representation of women in post apocalyptic fiction
Post apocalyptic fiction is the story set after the main events of the apocalypse, showing how many characters including women have evolved throughout.
The apocalypse has shown how some of these characters have changed pre and post apocalypse mainly post.

            
My personal definition:
The representation of women in post apocalyptic fiction is quite unique, they aren't just side characters who do housewife chores and eventually disappear, they offer their own story and help other characters develop and evolve which shows they are more than a side character and more of a main character in some way, showing they have worth in the story.
 They help nurture the survival and leadership themes of the story.
