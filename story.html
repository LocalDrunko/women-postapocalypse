        <h1>The Last Ember</h1>
        <p>The sky was a smothering sheet of smog, the sun a distant memory behind the thick veil of dust and smoke. Elena adjusted the tattered scarf around her face, shielding herself from the harsh winds. She had not seen another living soul in weeks.</p>
        <p>The world had drowned, then burned. What remained was a wasteland of ruins. Elena’s mission was survival, and survival meant finding the others. She thought of her daughter, Rosa, taken by raiders months ago.</p>
        <p>Then, movement. A woman, wary but not cruel. "You alone?" she asked. Elena hesitated but nodded.</p>
        <p>"I’m looking for my daughter. Raiders took her east."</p>
        <p>"I know where they camp," the stranger said. "But you won’t make it alone."</p>
        <p>Two women, bound by survival, set off together. Under the dim, ember-streaked sky, Elena felt something stir deep inside her—hope.</p>
